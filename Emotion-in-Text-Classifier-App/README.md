# Emotion-in-Text-Classifier-App
This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) web application that detects emotions from text input. Users can enter any sentence or phrase, and the app will analyze the content and predict the underlying emotionâ€”such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, or surprise.  The application is built using Python and Streamlit for an interactive frontend.
